# Vector 2D C++ Library

## Discription

The `Vector2D` is a simple **C++ library** that represents a **2D vector** with `x` and `y` values. This library provides basic vector operations such as addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and dot product. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient for use in games, simulations, or mathematical calculations.

## Features

- Getters and setters for the `x` and `y` coordinates.
- Vector normalization and length calculation.
- Basic vector operations such as addition, subtraction, and compound assignment.
- Lightweight and easy to use.

## Installation

To use the `Vector2D` library, simply include the header file in your C++ project:
```cpp
#include "Vector2D.h"
```
